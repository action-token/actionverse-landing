# Empowering Positive Actions Through Blockchain Technology
ACTION tokens encourage consumers to take positive actions in the physical world. Connect with organizations, philanthropies, and brands in the Actionverse.

ACTION tokens and associated applications exist to encourage consumers taking positive actions in the physical world. The tokens are demanded by brands, philanthropies, and organizations motivating and marketing these actions within the Actionverse application. They need tokens to provide incentives as well as pay application fees.

The Actionverse will empower the connection of organizations to individuals through physical actions. Proprietary augmented reality and token-gated technology enables incredibly unique use cases. Users will be enabled to collect various digital goods by physically traveling and searching locations as well as completing tasks. They can then redeem these collectibles for unique digital and physically (some geographically bound) rewards.
